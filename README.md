#  Insurance Claim Prediction

This machine learning project aims to predict whether a customer will file an insurance claim based on various features such as age, vehicle damage, policy premiums, and driving experience. The goal is to help insurance companies improve risk assessment and decision-making.

##  Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Binary classification using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Files Included
- `Insurance_Claim_Prediction.ipynb` â€“ Main notebook with full analysis and model results

##  How to Run
